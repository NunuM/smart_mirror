# Youtube to MP3 Python Player

This script is an effort to make my life easier when it comes to downloading and listening to music. It is a simple python script that
does a youtube search and then plays the music using python's Pyglet module.

External Modules Used:
>1. pafy: Python module for youtube videos.
>2. pyglet: Python module for playing media.
>3. BeautifulSoup: Python module for parsing through xml/html files.
